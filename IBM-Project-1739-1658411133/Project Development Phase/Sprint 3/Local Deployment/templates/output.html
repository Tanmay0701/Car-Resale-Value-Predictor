            <div class="textS">The price of any car over the years depreciates and is dependent upon various factors that
                determine the
                resale
                value of the car. These factors range from year of purchase, make, model, kilometers driven and overall
                condition of the car. Used car valuation incorporates all these factors into the pricing model that
                takes
                into
                account data from millions of buyers & sellers of used cars to determine the most accurate price range
                for
                your
                car.
