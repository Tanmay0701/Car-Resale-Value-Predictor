# LITERATURE SURVEY


## INTRODUCTION
‘Predicting the Price of Used Cars Using Machine Learning Techniques’ according to author Sameerchand Pudaruth they have done the predictions of car price from the historical data that has been collected from daily newspapers.Many other algorithms such as multiple linear regression, k- nearest neighbor algorithms , naïve based, and some decision tree algorithms also been used. All the four algorithms are compared and found the best algorithm for prediction. They have faced some difficulties in comparing the algorithms, somehow they have managed. According to authors Pattabiraman, this paper is more concentrated on the relation between seller and buyer. In order to predict the price of four wheelers, more features arerequired such as already given price, mileage, make, model,trim, type, cylinder, liter, doors, cruise, sound, leather.Using these features the price of vehicle has been predictedwith the help of statistical analysis system for exploratory data analysis.


## ALGORITHMS
To anticipate the value of pre-owned automobiles in Mauritius, Pudaruth employed naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, multiple linear regression, and decision trees. However, because there were fewer car sobserved, their results were not good for prediction. In his article, Pudaruth concluded that decision trees and naive Bayes are ineffective for continuous-valued variables. To anticipate the price of a vehicle, Noor and Jan employed multiple linear regression. They used a variable selection methodology to determine the variables that had the highest influence and then eliminated the remainder. Only a few variables are included in the data, which were utilised to create the linear regression model. With an R-square of 98 percent, the outcome was outstanding To accurately anticipate the price of a car, many different approaches have been used in the digital world, ranging from machine learning approaches like multiple linear regression, k-nearest neighbor, and naive bayes to random forest and decision tree to the SAS enterprise miner.

By considering the following attributes such as brand, year of production and type of engine they predicted a model which has similar results as the simple regression model. Moreover, they made an expert system named ODAV (Optimal Distribution of Auction Vehicles) as there is a high demand for selling the by vehicles at the end of the leasing year by vehicle dealers. This system gives insights into the best prices for vehicles, as well as the location where the best price can be gained. To predict a price of vehicles, the K – nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm has been used which is based on regression models. More number of vehicles has been exchanged through this system so this particular system is more successfully managed.

## BIAS- UNDERFITTING AND OVERFITTING
Overfitting and  underfitting come  into  picture when  we create our statistical models. The models might be too biased to the training data and might not perform well on the test data set. This is called overfitting. Likewise, the models might not take  into  consideration  all  the  variance  present  in  the population and perform poorly on a test data set. This is called underfitting. A perfect balance needs to be achieved between these  two,  which  leads  to  the  concept  of  Bias-Variance tradeoff. Pierre Geurts  has introduced and explained how bias-variance  tradeoff  is  achieved  in  both  regression  and classification. The selection of variables/attribute plays a vital role in influencing both the bias and variance of the statistical model. Robert Tibshirani proposed a new method called Lasso,  which minimizes the  residual  sum  of  squares. This returns a  subset of  attributes which need  to be  included in multiple regression to get the minimal error rate. Similarly, decision  trees  suffer  from  overfitting  if  they  are  not pruned/shrunk. Trevor  Hastie and Daryl Pregibon have explained the concept of pruning  in  their  research  paper. Moreover,  hypothesis  testing using  ANOVA is  needed  to verify whether the different groups of errors really differ from each other.This is explained by TK Kim and Tae Kyun in their paper.

We attempted to construct a web application where a user may verify the effective market price of their automobiles using a model for prediction based on the factors that have the greatest impact on vehicle prices.

## CARS24
CARS24 is a next generation ecommerce platform for pre-owned cars. They provide the best experience for car buyers by offering a wide assortment of certified cars that are home delivered in a click of a button while sellers get the best price of their vehicles in less than 1 hour. Valuation requires expertise. And when it comes to valuing an asset as precious as a car, it becomes all the more critical. Despite being an owner, one is unaware of the used car valuation of his/her asset. Getting tricked by the false car valuation isn’t something new so you need to be extra cautious to strike the right chord while evaluating your car resale value.
